<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: August 20, 2023</p>

<p>Nicholas Mawulorm, operating under Vesel Inc., has developed the GPA Calculator app ("App") as a free app for educational purposes. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from users of the App.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The App does not collect any personal information, including but not limited to location, identity, or any other identifiable data. The only information collected is the date, time, and Android ID of the device using the App. This data is solely used for the purpose of monitoring app usage frequency and does not reveal any personal or sensitive information about the user.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App utilizes third-party services for analytics and crash reporting. These services may collect anonymous usage data to help us understand user interactions and improve the user experience. However, no personally identifiable information is collected, stored, or shared through these services.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>The data collected, including the date, time, and Android ID, is securely stored in Google Firebase. We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of this data and prevent unauthorized access. Only Nicholas Mawulorm, the developer, has access to this data. The developer also has the ability to remotely stop a user from using the app if necessary.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is intended for users of all ages, including children aged 13 and below. We do not collect any personal information from users, and no user account creation is required. Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their children's use of the App to ensure a safe and educational experience.</p>
